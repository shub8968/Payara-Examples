        <h1>Realm-based Security Example</h1>
        <p>
            This example demonstrates a Jakarta EE Security based on realms. The realm used
            is `file`, one of the default realms defined by Payara. You can manage users
            using admin GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can try several pages, either unsecured or under some level of protection:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="info">info</a> – user info, displays user name and roles of the user</li>
            <li><a href="public.xhtml">public.xhtml</a> – public page</li>
            <li><a href="secured/users.xhtml">secured/users.xhtml</a> – page protected by password, accessible to all users</li>
            <li><a href="secured/SecuredServlet">secured/SecuredServlet</a> – servlet protected by password, accessible to all users</li>
            <li><a href="secured-ssl/users.xhtml">secured-ssl/users.xhtml</a> – page protected by password, accessible to all users, but only via secure HTTPS</li>
            <li><a href="admin/admins.xhtml">admin/admins.xhtml</a> – page protected by password, accessible only to all administrators. Regular users will get <tt>403 - access denied</tt>.</li>
            <li><a href="logout">logout</a> – logout</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            REST resources:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="rest/v1/public">rest/v1/public</a> – public resource</li>
            <li><a href="rest/v1/protected">rest/v1/protected</a> – protected resource</li>
            <li><a href="rest/v1/admin">rest/v1/admin</a> – protected resource for <tt>admin</tt> users</li>
            <li><a href="rest/v1/public/me">rest/v1/public/me</a> – information about logged-in user</li>
            <li><a href="rest/v1/security/login?username=Adam&amp;password=Eve">rest/v1/security/login?username=Adam&amp;password=Eve</a> – login Adam</li>
            <li><a href="rest/v1/security/login?username=admin&amp;password=5FsNqxmBug6x4eR">rest/v1/security/login?username=admin&amp;password=5FsNqxmBug6x4eR</a> – login Adam</li>
            <li><a href="rest/v1/security/logout">rest/v1/security/logout</a> – logout</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These accounts are available:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>user <tt>Adam</tt> in group <tt>user</tt>, password <tt>Eve</tt></li>
            <li>privileged user <tt>admin</tt> in groups <tt>admin</tt> and <tt>user</tt>, password <tt>5FsNqxmBug6x4eR</tt></li>
        </ul>
